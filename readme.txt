CBM/MOS/CSG IC Library for Kicad
================================
I use Kicad for my various Commodore electronic projects. I found that there was no existing library for the custom MOS/CSG parts.

* CBM.LIB       - Standard 8-bit Chips used in 8-bit Commodore machines
* CBM-STEVE.LIB - Additional vintage non-CBM chips (RAM, ROM, Sound, Video, support chips etc)
